The second update of the 3.6.x release of [simmer](http://r-simmer.org/), the Discrete-Event Simulator for R, is on CRAN, thus inaugurating a bi-monthly release cycle. I must thank Duncan Garmonsway (@[nacnudus](https://github.com/nacnudus)) for creating and now maintaining ["The Bank Tutorial: Part I"](http://r-simmer.org/articles/simmer-04-bank-1.html) vignette, Franz Fuchs for finding an important and weird memory bug ([here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/simmer-devel/A4M7uP0Lmgw)) that prevented `simmer` from freeing the allocated memory (all 3.x.x versions are affected up to this release), and the `Rcpp` people [for enduring me](https://github.com/RcppCore/Rcpp/issues/693) while I was helplessly searching for a solution to this. :)

My special thanks to Kevin Ushey (@[kevinushey](https://github.com/kevinushey)), who finally [found the bug](https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr/issues/146#issuecomment-301624507). As it happens, the bug was not in `simmer` or `Rcpp` but  in `magrittr`, and the problem is that the pipe operator, in its inscrutable magic, creates a new environment for unnamed functions (instead of the current one, as it should be), and there it stores a reference to the first object in the pipe. More or less. Further details [here](https://github.com/tidyverse/magrittr/issues/146#issuecomment-301805434).

Anyway, if somebody faces the same problem, know that there is a workaround: you just need to delete that hidden reference, [as `simmer` does in this release](https://github.com/r-simmer/simmer/blob/master/R/utils.R#L53) to get rid of the memory issues. Happy simmering!

### Minor changes and fixes:

* Update "The Bank Tutorial: Part I" vignette (@nacnudus in #90).
* Fix `trap()`'s handler cloning and associated test (#91).
* Apply `select()`'s `policy` also when `resources` is a function (#92).
* Accept dynamic timeouts in batches (#93).
* Change `rollback()`'s default behaviour to `times=Inf`, i.e., infinite loop (#95).
* Stop and throw an error when `timeout()` returns a missing value (#96 and #97).
* Fix memory management: resetting the environment was clearing but not deallocating memory (#98, fixed in #99).
* Fix object destruction: workaround for tidyverse/magrittr#146 (#98, fixed in effcb6b).
