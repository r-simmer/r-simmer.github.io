The 3.7.0 release of [simmer](http://r-simmer.org/), the Discrete-Event Simulator for R, is on CRAN. It includes several API improvements and bug fixes. Among the former, the new `timeout_from_attribute()` activity makes it easier and more efficient the common task of placing a timeout based on a previously set attribute. Another common task is to increment or decrement a given attribute. To this end, `set_attribute` and other _setters_ get a new argument `mod` which, if set to `"+"` or `"*"`, modifies the value correspondingly instead of substituting it.

This minor release also includes some minor breaking changes. In particular, all deprecations from the v3.6.x series have been finally removed, which should come as no surprise. Besides, `get_mon_resources()` loses the `data` argument, which was there for historical reasons and probably nobody was using it.

Finally, there are two additional vignettes:

- ["simmer: Discrete-Event Simulation for R"](https://r-simmer.org/articles/simmer-02-jss.pdf) describes the internal design, the R API, provides some modelling examples and a performance evaluation. We are very proud to officially announce that it has been accepted for publication in the _Journal of Statistical Software_.
- ["Design and Analysis of 5G Scenarios"](https://r-simmer.org/articles/simmer-aa-5g) contains supplementary materials for a homonymous paper that has been accepted for publication in the _IEEE Communications Magazine_.

### New features:

* New `timeout_from_attribute()` activity makes it easier to set a timeout based on an attribute (#129).
* The activities `set_attribute()`, `set_prioritization()`, `set_capacity()` and `set_queue_size()` get a new argument `mod` which, if set to `"+"` or `"*"`, modifies the corresponding value instead of substituting it. This makes it easier to increment, decrement or scale one of these values (#130).
* New `*_selected()` versions for the already available resource getters: `get_capacity()`, `get_queue seize()`, `get_server_count()` and `get_queue_count()` (#134).

### Minor changes and fixes:

* Broadcast signals with higher priority to prevent an arrival to catch its own signal with a `trap()` after a `send()` (#135).
* Generate new arrivals with minimum priority to avoid wrong interactions with simultaneous activities (#136).
* Remove v3.6.x deprecations: the old attribute retrieval system (see notes for v3.6.3), as well as methods `create_trajectory()` and `onestep()` (#117).
* Remove `get_mon_resources()`'s `data` argument. It was there for historical reasons and probably nobody was using it (851d34b).
* New vignette, "simmer: Discrete-Event Simuation for R", paper accepted for publication in the Journal of Statistical Software. Remove "Terminology" vignette (#127).
* New vignette, "Design and Analysis of 5G Scenarios", supplementary materials for a paper accepted for publication in the IEEE Communications Magazine (#137).
