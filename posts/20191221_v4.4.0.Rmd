The 4.4.0 release of [simmer](http://r-simmer.org/), the Discrete-Event Simulator for R, is on CRAN. This update stabilises a new pace of a couple of new releases per year, which is more appropriate given the maturity that the project has reached.

This release brings us a dozen bug fixes and improvements, including the unification of the `leave`/`renege` API, further enhancements of convenience function to set up generators, and performance improvements for the simulation environment definition thanks to the vectorisation of `add_resource` and `add_generator`. See below for a complete list of changes.

### New features

- Add `out` and `keep_seized` parameters to `leave()` with the same behaviour as
  in `renege_in()` and `renege_if()`. Code and documentation of these functions
  are now integrated under `help(renege)` (#208, #217).
- Convenience functions `from`, `to` and `from_to` accept dynamic parameters
  for arguments `start_time`, `stop_time` and `every` (#219).
- Activities to interact with sources have been vectorised to modify multiple
  sources at once (#222).
- Several generators or resources with the same parameters can be added with a
  single call to `add_generator()` and `add_resource()` respectively if a vector
  of names is provided (#221).

### Minor changes and fixes:

- Fix `get_mon_*()` dispatch for named lists (#210).
- Get/put the RNG state when random numbers are required in the backend (#218).
- Fix convenience functions `from`, `to` and `from_to` to preserve the
  environment of the supplied functions (as part of #219).
- Documentation improvements (#212, #220).
- Fix queueing in multiple resources after preemption (#224 addressing #206).
